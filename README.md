## üìå Project Description

This project is a special creation made with love and tech, a digital keepsake designed to celebrate graduation and create lasting memories for my friends and loved ones. It‚Äôs more than just electronics, it‚Äôs a symbol of connection, gratitude, and unforgettable moments.

As we step into the next chapter of our lives, **I wanted to leave behind something meaningful and personal**. This ESP32-based digital photo frame is my way of saying "thank you for being part of my journey", and making sure a part of me stays with the people who matter to me the most.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning and Caution
**Do Not:**
1. Supply above 5V direct to ESP32
2. Short Circuit 
3. Mad if failed, it just matter of time

**Do:**
1. Have fun with your project!
2. Keep you body healthy :D
3. Patient 

### üõ†Ô∏èFeel free to improve or tweak the code!
